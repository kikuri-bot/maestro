# Maestro
Maestro is a painter component of the [Kikuri Bot Project](https://kikuri-bot.com/). It's a HTTP API that allows for real-time rendering of game cards and other graphics. The API is designed to work as micro service that is cache-free and doesn't rely on other components - making it suitable for use in a variety of contexts. It requires `CDN` (private) repository that holds source files used for render.
